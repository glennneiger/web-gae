<p>Each weekly report of <b><i>Minyanville's  World in Review with Hoofy &amp; Boo </i></b>takes a look at a relevant financial  topic and delivers it in a way that is smart, meaningful, and  entertaining.  The gap between what  people need to know about their finances and what they actually do know has  never been greater. The challenge with bridging the gap in financial  understanding is providing content that is not only informative, but also  entertaining—which is why we've chosen animation as a creative technique.</p>
<p>Animation is a tremendous equalizer. The genre is now not  only an accepted form, but in the new media landscape, a respected one.  Business and financial news used to be the  province of a few.  Wall Street and Main Street rarely  intersected.  With <b><i>Minyanville's World in Review with Hoofy &amp; Boo</i></b>, this is no  longer the case.</p>
<p>People are very emotionally connected to their money, but  also very intimidated by the thought of managing it. The growing number of  financial websites, television networks, and &quot;instant experts&quot; has made it  difficult to know what's important. <b><i>Minyanville's  World in Review with Hoofy &amp; Boo</i></b> connects with people viscerally  through humor and insight.  The show is  Emmy-worthy because it raises the level of financial understanding while  reducing that intimidation factor.</p>
