    <tr><td><p><i>Hoofy &amp; Boo's News &amp; Views</i> is the world’s first (and only) animated news show.</p>
	<p>The financial crisis of 2008/2009 was the most important business and financial story in decades. Emotions ran incredibly high at precisely the time when clearer heads should have prevailed.</p>
    <p>People questioned everything from the security of the financial system to the very concept of capitalism itself.</p>
	<p>Everyone from the C-suite to the mailroom was impacted, and the Secretary of the Treasury on down to the average Joe tried to make sense of what it all meant.</p>
    <p><i>Hoofy &amp; Boo's News &amp; Views</i> covered virtually every aspect of the financial meltdown from the forces that defined the economic disaster to the drivers that contributed to the subsequent fall out. The show put the events in perspective, utilizing a blend of fact and humor to explain what was happening.</p>
	<p>Our mission was to explain each facet of this global event in a way that was intelligent, thoughtful, and digestible for all audiences. Animation worked to our advantage, as it allowed us to combine smart reportage with a wink and a smile to explain a complex and ever-changing situation.</p>
	<p>Pundits and experts tried desperately to decipher what was occurring in the markets; shouting, hyperbole, and the search for instant answers were the order of the day.</p>
    <p>When many were acting like cartoon characters, we believe Minyanville’s cartoon characters delivered a balance of fact, insight, and analysis (with a dash of humor) making a rough stretch a bit more palatable.</p>
	<p>A little levity goes a long way -perhaps all the way to a better understanding of what happened and why.</p></td></tr>

	<tr><td><b>1) That’s Oil Folks: How the Price of Oil Affected Two of America’s Largest Companies</b></td></tr>
	<tr><td height="20">Airdate: 8/15/2008</td></tr>

	    <tr><td><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td width=5%>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The goal of this episode was to examine how the price of oil impacted the fortunes (and in one case the fate) of two of America’s largest corporations-Exxon/Mobil and General Motors. The importance of this piece was to examine the implications of the rising cost of oil and the extent of its reach.</p>
	    <p>Hoofy and Boo’s report explained to audiences just how serious the rise in oil prices could be and the staggering financial impact it had—both positively and negatively on companies that depend on black gold.</p></td></tr>

	<tr><td><b>2) Stock Wars: Short Selling and its Role in the Markets</b></td></tr>
	<tr><td height="20">Airdate: 9/12/2008</td></tr>

		<tr><td><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td width=5%>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The goal of this episode was to explain the role of short selling in market events, and to explain how this affected the companies involved.</p>
		<p>The importance of this story was rooted in the fact that Patrick Byrne, CEO of Overstock.com, was quoted as saying that Sith Lords were responsible for the decline in his company’s share price—which was an interesting perspective, to say the least. Hoofy and Boo’s report impacted audiences by taking a complex subject and breaking it down into a simple and understandable report.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr>

		<tr><td><b>3) Money for Nothing: CEO Severance</b></td></tr>

		<tr><td><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td width=5%>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The goal of this episode was to show that while financial institutions were failing or being bailed out by taxpayers, the people who ran them (in many cases right into the ground) were walking away with outlandishly generous severance packages.</p>
		<p>Hoofy and Boo’s report impacted audiences by putting into perspective the fact that the CEO compensation system was in need of repair, and that corporate governance standards were sorely lacking.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr>

		<tr><td><b>4) Eulogy: The Death of Capitalism?</b></td></tr>
		<tr><td height="20">Airdate: 10/1/2008</td></tr>

		<tr><td><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td width=5%>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The goal of this episode was to examine the issue of government intervention in the capitalist system. The steps that the Fed and the US government took in the autumn of 2008 were unprecedented; many felt that the government had gone too far, and could have led to the end of capitalism. This piece raised the question of how much intervention is too much, and provoked thought while putting into perspective the historic nature of what the Fed was doing.</p>
		<p>Hoofy and Boo’s report impacted audiences by explaining the depth of federal intervention as well as its implications. It also pointed out to the audience that the death of capitalism has been prematurely reported many times before, only to correct itself and rise phoenix-like from the ashes.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr>


		<tr><td><b>5) Buy Buy American Pie: The Weak Dollar and Foreign Investment</b></td></tr>

		<tr><td><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td width=5%>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The goal of this episode was to examine the effects that the global recession would have on the weakening dollar and foreign investment in the United States, beginning with the sale of an American landmark, the Chrysler Building, for $800 million to Dubai. The importance of this segment was to take a look at the long-range implications of US monetary policy, its impact on the dollar and the ability of American companies to effectively compete going forward.</p>
		<p>Hoofy and Boo’s report impacted audiences by using a simple humorous premise to highlight a serious issue—the plight of the US dollar.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr>

		<tr><td><b>6) What Would John Thain Do?</b></td></tr>
		<tr><td height="20">Airdate: 2/4/2009</td></tr>

		<tr><td><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td width=5%>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The goal of this episode was to report on the breaking news that John Thain had spent more than $1.2 million on his office redesign while Merrill Lynch was hemorrhaging money. The importance of the piece was point out both the details of how the money was spent and the absurdity of it being spent at all.</p>
		<p>Hoofy and Boo’s report impacted audiences by detailing the excesses of Wall Street—which were not limited to the risk profiles of a given firm’s portfolios—as well as how changing the storied culture of Wall Street will not be an easy task.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr>

		<tr><td><b>7) The Federal Reserve Performs a Financial Exorcism</b></td></tr>
		<tr><td height="20">Airdate: 8/6/2008</td></tr>

		<tr><td><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td width=5%>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The goal of this episode—the second of a two-part report—was for Hoofy and Boo to take a look at the efforts of Fed Chairman Ben Bernanke as he tried to save the economy.</p>
		<p>This piece explained that the economic expansion we were experiencing was based on credit and akin to selling our economic souls to the Devil, and that intervention by the Federal Reserve during major economic crises is difficult, risky, and not always a sure success.</p>
		<p>Hoofy and Boo’s report on this issue impacted audiences by illustrating the multitude of economic issues facing the Fed as well as the difficulty in getting these initiatives to work.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr>

		<tr><td><p><b>8) Gimme Shelter: The End of the Financial World as We Know It?</b></p></td></tr>
		<tr><td height="20">Airdate: 10/10/2008</td></tr>

		<tr><td><table width="100%" cellpadding="0" cellspacing="0" border="0"><tr><td width=5%>&nbsp;</td><td><p>The goal of this episode was to highlight that while the economic collapse was both significant and troublesome, it was not, as some were predicting, the end of the world. Social unrest, increased gun sales, and the construction of self-contained, off-the-grid underground bunkers were panicked overreactions reflecting the general hysteria of the moment.</p>
		<p>The most important impact of Hoofy and Boo’s report was to point out how emotions can run high during times of market turbulence, and that sometimes those emotions can lead investors to make rash decisions. The net takeaway? Keep your head. Emotion is the enemy of successful investing.</p></td></tr></table></td></tr>
