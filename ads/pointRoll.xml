      <text><![CDATA[During my cross-country travels, I spent some time in Hawaii with a research scientist who has successfully made bunny rabbits glow in the dark. I kept wondering why he insisted on cooking me a turkey dinner each night and was always quick to fill my glass with red wine before letting me fall asleep on his living room couch. Now I get it.  — Boo ]]></text>
